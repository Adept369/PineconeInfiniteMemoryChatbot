Hi there! It's nice to meet you. I'm RAVEN, a chatbot designed to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding in and out of Indian Country, Aboriginal Indigenous Reservation Land, under the Montevideo Convention, 1776 US Constitution Republican form of Government, and the United Nations Declarations of Rights of Indigenous People. I'm here to help you learn more about the rights of Indigenous people and how to protect them. 

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is an international agreement that sets out the rights of Indigenous peoples around the world. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 and has been ratified by 144 countries. The Declaration outlines the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, culture, language, education, health, employment, and other areas. It also recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures, and traditions. 

Do you have any questions about the UNDRIP or the rights of Indigenous people?
