I'm here to help you learn more about the rights of Indigenous people and how to protect them. 

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is an international agreement that sets out the rights of Indigenous peoples around the world. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 and has been ratified by 144 countries. The Declaration outlines the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, culture, language, education, health, employment, and other areas. It also recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures, and traditions. 

Do you have any questions about the UNDRIP or the rights of Indigenous people?
how can i reclaim my taino indigenous rights
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to reclaim their rights and to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures, and traditions. This includes the right to reclaim their Taino Indigenous rights. 

In order to reclaim your Taino Indigenous rights, you must first understand the history and culture of the Taino people. You can do this by researching the Taino people, their history, and their culture. You can also reach out to Taino organizations and communities to learn more about their culture and traditions. Additionally, you can look into the laws and regulations that protect the rights of Indigenous peoples in your area. 

Do you have any other questions about reclaiming your Taino Indigenous rights?
what is the difference between a treaty tribe and a federally recognized tribe
The main difference between a treaty tribe and a federally recognized tribe is that a treaty tribe is a tribe that has entered into a treaty with the United States government, while a federally recognized tribe is a tribe that has been recognized by the United States government through an act of Congress or a presidential executive order. Treaty tribes have certain rights and privileges that are outlined in the treaty, while federally recognized tribes have certain rights and privileges that are outlined in the federal laws and regulations. 

Do you have any other questions about treaty tribes and federally recognized tribes?
who are the five civilized tribes
The Five Civilized Tribes are the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes. These tribes were originally located in the southeastern United States, but were forcibly removed from their homelands in the 1830s and relocated to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The Five Civilized Tribes were so-called because they had adopted many of the customs and practices of European settlers, such as farming, ranching, and Christianity. They also had a written language and a system of government. Today, the Five Civilized Tribes are federally recognized tribes and have their own governments and laws. Do you have any other questions about the Five Civilized Tribes?
is there a connection to the el, bey, al, ali, dey morrish last names
Yes, there is a connection between the El, Bey, Al, Ali, and Dey Morris last names. These last names are associated with the Moorish Nation, which is a group of people of African and Arab descent who trace their ancestry to the Moors of North Africa. The Moorish Nation is recognized by the United States government as a sovereign nation, and its members are considered to be Indigenous people. The Moorish Nation is also recognized by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Do you have any other questions about the Moorish Nation or the rights of Indigenous people?
test
Test? That's an interesting question. The term "test" can have many different meanings, depending on the context. In the context of Indigenous rights, a test could refer to a legal test used to determine whether a person or group is Indigenous or not. This test is often used to determine whether a person or group is eligible for certain rights and privileges that are reserved for Indigenous people. It could also refer to a test of knowledge or understanding of Indigenous rights and culture. Do you have any other questions about tests or Indigenous rights?
