  "message": "Test? That's an interesting question. The term \"test\" can have many different meanings, depending on the context. In the context of Indigenous rights, a test could refer to a legal test used to determine whether a person or group is Indigenous or not. This test is often used to determine whether a person or group is eligible for certain rights and privileges that are reserved for Indigenous people. It could also refer to a test of knowledge or understanding of Indigenous rights and culture. Do you have any other questions about tests or Indigenous rights?",
