  "message": "The Montevideo Convention is an international agreement that was adopted in 1933 and is considered to be the cornerstone of international law. It outlines the rights and duties of states, including the right to self-determination, the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, and the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. The Convention also recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination and the protection of their rights. It is an important document for Indigenous peoples, as it provides a legal framework for the protection of their rights. Do you have any other questions about the Montevideo Convention or the rights of Indigenous people?",
