  "message": "The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to reclaim their rights and to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures, and traditions. This includes the right to reclaim their Taino Indigenous rights. \n\nIn order to reclaim your Taino Indigenous rights, you must first understand the history and culture of the Taino people. You can do this by researching the Taino people, their history, and their culture. You can also reach out to Taino organizations and communities to learn more about their culture and traditions. Additionally, you can look into the laws and regulations that protect the rights of Indigenous peoples in your area. \n\nDo you have any other questions about reclaiming your Taino Indigenous rights?",
