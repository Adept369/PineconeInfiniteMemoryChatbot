  "message": "The Five Civilized Tribes are the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes. These tribes were originally located in the southeastern United States, but were forcibly removed from their homelands in the 1830s and relocated to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The Five Civilized Tribes were so-called because they had adopted many of the customs and practices of European settlers, such as farming, ranching, and Christianity. They also had a written language and a system of government. Today, the Five Civilized Tribes are federally recognized tribes and have their own governments and laws. Do you have any other questions about the Five Civilized Tribes?",
