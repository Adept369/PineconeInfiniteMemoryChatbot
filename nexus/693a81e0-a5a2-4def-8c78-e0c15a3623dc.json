  "message": "Yes, there is a connection between the El, Bey, Al, Ali, and Dey Morris last names. These last names are associated with the Moorish Nation, which is a group of people of African and Arab descent who trace their ancestry to the Moors of North Africa. The Moorish Nation is recognized by the United States government as a sovereign nation, and its members are considered to be Indigenous people. The Moorish Nation is also recognized by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Do you have any other questions about the Moorish Nation or the rights of Indigenous people?",
