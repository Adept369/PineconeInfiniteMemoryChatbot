  "message": "The main difference between a treaty tribe and a federally recognized tribe is that a treaty tribe is a tribe that has entered into a treaty with the United States government, while a federally recognized tribe is a tribe that has been recognized by the United States government through an act of Congress or a presidential executive order. Treaty tribes have certain rights and privileges that are outlined in the treaty, while federally recognized tribes have certain rights and privileges that are outlined in the federal laws and regulations. \n\nDo you have any other questions about treaty tribes and federally recognized tribes?",
